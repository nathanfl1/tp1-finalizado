        <P>
            Known early on as Long Acre (also spelled Longacre) Square, it had an unsavory reputation as the centre of
            illicit activity in the 1890s, though earlier in the 19th century it had been both a commercial and a
            residential area. The square was renamed in 1904 for The New York Times, which opened its new offices in the
            Times Tower on the square (though it would outgrow them by 1913). Almost immediately the square became the
            place where New Yorkers gathered to celebrate the arrival of the new year. In 1907 the Times began lowering
            a huge glass ball down its flagpole at midnight on New Year’s Eve to mark the occasion. Throughout the
            years, ever more sophisticated technology was used for the square’s ball drop as the tradition came to
            include live television broadcasts that shared the experience with tens of millions of people across the
            United States.

        <p>The name “Times Square” was developed by Albert Ochs in 1904. Ochs, the renowned publisher of The New York
            Times, elected to move his paper to the then-Long Acre Square. After the move, the square was changed to
            reflect the new ownership.

            Before The New York Times moved, Long Acre Square was merely a set of brownstone buildings, developed by a
            man who saw potential in the location. New Yorkers raced to the new square, desperate to make a home for
            themselves in this new place. Before long, a new district began to grow around them. Crime became
            commonplace, and prostitution and theft began to thrive.

            Things began to change in the 1880s. With the spread of electricity, Long Acre Square suddenly seemed much
            safer for residents. Street lights and advertisements began to dominate the area. In 1895, a new resident,
            Oscar Hammerstein I, made the decision to create an entertainment industry in the square. He called his new
            locations Olympia, a structure that featured three theaters. Before long, more theaters began to sprout from
            seemingly everywhere. By the time The New York Times arrived, the area was an established entertainment
            haven.
