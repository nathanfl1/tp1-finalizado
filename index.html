        <h1>HISTORY</h1>
        <p> Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City is composed of five boroughs, each of
            which is a county of the State of New York. The five boroughs—Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and
            Staten Island—were created when local governments were consolidated into a single city in 1898. The city
            and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As many
            as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world.
            New York is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the United States, the largest
            foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016. As of 2019, the New York metropolitan
            area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of $2.0 trillion. If the New York
            metropolitan area were a sovereign state, it would have the eighth-largest economy in the world. New York is
            home to the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world.
